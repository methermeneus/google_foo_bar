This is my solution to the first level-3 challenge I received for Google
foo.bar. I am putting it on GitHub because Google seems to have lost my
challenge after I submitted it.

This is actually my second solution. I actually completed a solution in
only a couple hours, but it was more brute-force, and while it worked on
the example cases on my computer, verify returned a memory error,
presumably on test cases with larger input strings. This one took some
thinking, and given that there's not much difference between how input
types are handled in Python, I decided to go with an
only-slightly-modified version of the more common minimum character
window problem.

These are my solutions to Google's foo.bar challenges. I originally had
just one solution (level 3: spy_snippets) on GitHub, which I put there to
reference in a bug report when foo.bar lost my progress. However, since
I've been getting some other bugs, (nothing else game-breaking yet, but
enough to make me worry), I decided I'd better put everything up.
Hopefully, having everything timestamped will help me out if I need to
complain.

And, yes, I know a lot of my solutions are suboptimal. In fact, a lot
start from brute force, then I slowly refine them until foo.bar stops
giving me memory errors and timeout errors. Not the best way to go about
things, I suppose, and it certainly leaves a lot to be desired in terms
of the final product, since that's generally just "good enough," but it
gets the job done, and I don't have enough time to do these, my day job,
AND efficiency analyses.

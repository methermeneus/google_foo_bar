def answer (population, x, y, strength):
    # your code here
    """
    Population: 2d array of rabbit population (to approximate each rabbits
    proximity to other rabbits, I suppose). Each value represents the rabbit's
    resistance to infection. Infected rabbits have a resistance of -1, and
    populations always start entirely uninfected.

    x and y are the coordinates in the array y,x of Patient Z, the first to be
    exposed to the virus.

    Strength is the ability of the virus to overcome resistance. Rabbit is
    infected iff strength >= resistance.

    Output a copy of population array with all infected rabbits' resistances
    changed to -1.

    Infected rabbits can only infect rabbits in orthoganally-adjacent cells.
    They cannot skip cells or affect diagonally-adjacent cells directly
    (though, of course, infecting a cell to the right, which affects a cell
    below, will get the diagonal cell anyway.)

    I used a multiply-linked-list to walk the population to simulate spread of
    the infection, then walk the list of infected to see which parts of the
    population array to change. That's probably more work than I really needed
    to do, but I'm still used to thinkin in C/C++, where that's pretty much the
    best solution.
